Uhh, uhh...
I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived I realized
Wherever you go that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So Imma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
Woo, ooh...
Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love is the only war worth fighting for
Wherever you go that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So Imma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while and die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
